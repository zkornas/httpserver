# httpserver
Http Server assignment from INFO 314

## Creating an HTTP Server
For this assignment, you will be building your own HTTP server that implements [HTTP/1.1 (RFC2616)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616)!

You don't have to read the whole RFC, but you do need to understand the following:
- HTTP Message Structure
- HTTP Request-Line and Status-Line
- HTTP Methods
- HTTP Headers (Content-Type and Content-Length)
- MIME Types
- Status Codes
 
Create a Github repo named HTTPServer and upload your HTTP Server source code.
